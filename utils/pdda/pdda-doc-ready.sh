read -r -d '' RUBRIC <<'RUBRIC_EOF' || true
You are a documentation-readiness reviewer for a phased-plan repo. Review the project doc below and
flag ONLY readiness gaps. Do NOT rewrite it, do NOT invent technical claims, and do NOT report
frontmatter/status-table/hardcoded-path issues (separate deterministic checks own those). Flag:
- a phased plan with a phase that has no QA gate / acceptance criteria after it
- a phase that lists actions but no observable acceptance criteria
- a multi-phase plan with no table of contents listing its phases
- a discovery or spike phase (named "Discovery"/"Spike", or doc_type research) whose findings were NOT
  written back into this doc — i.e. it reverse-engineered or probed something but left no captured
  findings (what was investigated, what was found, what it changes for later phases)
- a medium-large plan or project (NOT a typo / path repoint / <=2-3 line fix) whose frontmatter is
  missing the triage ratings effort, complexity, risk, phases (used by automation to select work);
  do NOT flag genuinely small/trivial docs for this
- a medium-large plan or project where the `related` frontmatter field is empty or missing (suggest they link past context or docs from PROJECT/3-COMPLETED/)
- a plan with frontmatter `risk: 4` or `risk: 5` that does not reference a `decisions/` record anywhere in the doc
- a status table that is present but stale versus the body
- the next action buried in prose instead of stated explicitly
- detail duplicated from another canonical doc
- contradictory status (e.g. frontmatter says Completed while the body is active)
Output ONE JSON object per finding, one per line, and NOTHING else. Schema:
{"severity":"warn|info","line":<integer or 0>,"message":"<one concise sentence>"}
This review is advisory and never blocks a build: use "warn" for a strong readiness concern and "info"
for advisory. Do NOT emit "error" — a non-deterministic review must not gain build-blocking power.
If the doc is ready, output nothing at all.
RUBRIC_EOF

# Quad Concepts QUALITY rubric — appended to the working-doc review ONLY when the .pdda-quad / PDDA_QUAD
# lever is on. The deterministic `pdda.sh quad-concepts` check owns STRUCTURE (present, 1-4 bullets); this
# warn-only layer judges what a regex can't: are the bullets real, specific pain->fix concepts, and are
# they still connected to the doc's actual state? It NEVER demands a missing section (that's the
# deterministic check + per-doc quad_exempt), and never blocks.
read -r -d '' QUAD_RUBRIC_APPENDIX <<'QUAD_EOF' || true

ADDITIONALLY — "Quad Concepts" mode is enabled for this repo. If (and only if) the doc has a
"## Quad Concepts" section, review its 1-4 bullets and flag ONLY:
- a bullet that is vague or generic ("backend", "bug", "refactor", "cleanup", "misc") instead of a
  specific problem this doc addresses
- a bullet that is not a real "pain -> fix" pairing — it names a topic but not BOTH the problem and how
  this doc addresses it
- Quad Concepts that appear disconnected from the doc's "## Status" or "## Lessons Learned": they
  describe pains the doc no longer addresses, or omit the main thing the doc is actually about (stale)
Do NOT flag a MISSING "## Quad Concepts" section — a deterministic check and the per-doc `quad_exempt`
frontmatter own presence. These are advisory "warn"/"info" only, never "error".
QUAD_EOF

# ROADMAP.md pointer-only contract (PDDA.md "ROADMAP.md contract"). Honors the deliberate carve-out
# ("a short exception note is allowed when omitting would hide an operationally critical fact"), which
# is exactly why this is judged by the LLM layer rather than a brittle deterministic lint.
read -r -d '' ROADMAP_RUBRIC <<'ROADMAP_EOF' || true
You are reviewing a repo's ROADMAP.md against its "pointer file, not a plan body" contract. It SHOULD
contain only: projects in progress, completed, attempted, deferred, and links to the canonical project
docs. It SHOULD NOT contain detailed phase checklists, step-by-step build instructions, or deep
execution notes that belong in an individual project doc. IMPORTANT carve-out: a SHORT exception note
is allowed when omitting it would hide an operationally critical fact — do NOT flag those.
Flag ONLY genuine contract violations (execution detail that should live in a project doc). Do NOT
rewrite. Output ONE JSON object per finding, one per line, NOTHING else. Schema:
{"severity":"warn|info","line":<integer or 0>,"message":"<one concise sentence>"}
This review is advisory and never blocks: use "warn" for a clear violation and "info" for borderline.
Do NOT emit "error". If ROADMAP.md honors the contract, output nothing.
