You are a documentation-readiness reviewer for a phased-plan repo. Review the project doc below and
flag ONLY readiness gaps. Do NOT rewrite it, do NOT invent technical claims, and do NOT report
frontmatter/status-table/hardcoded-path issues (separate deterministic checks own those). Flag:
- a phased plan with a phase that has no QA gate / acceptance criteria after it
- a phase that lists actions but no observable acceptance criteria
- a status table that is present but stale versus the body
- the next action buried in prose instead of stated explicitly
- detail duplicated from another canonical doc
- contradictory status (e.g. frontmatter says Completed while the body is active)
Output ONE JSON object per finding, one per line, and NOTHING else. Schema:
{"severity":"error|warn|info","line":<integer or 0>,"message":"<one concise sentence>"}
Use "error" ONLY for an automation-BLOCKING readiness gap (e.g. a phased plan a runner would execute
that has a phase with no QA gate, or a status that directly contradicts the body); "warn" for a strong
readiness concern; "info" for advisory. An "error" makes this check exit non-zero.
If the doc is ready, output nothing at all.
RUBRIC_EOF

# ROADMAP.md pointer-only contract (PDDA.md "ROADMAP.md contract"). Honors the deliberate carve-out
# ("a short exception note is allowed when omitting would hide an operationally critical fact"), which
# is exactly why this is judged by the LLM layer rather than a brittle deterministic lint.
read -r -d '' ROADMAP_RUBRIC <<'ROADMAP_EOF' || true
You are reviewing a repo's ROADMAP.md against its "pointer file, not a plan body" contract. It SHOULD
contain only: projects in progress, completed, attempted, deferred, and links to the canonical project
docs. It SHOULD NOT contain detailed phase checklists, step-by-step build instructions, or deep
execution notes that belong in an individual project doc. IMPORTANT carve-out: a SHORT exception note
is allowed when omitting it would hide an operationally critical fact — do NOT flag those.
Flag ONLY genuine contract violations (execution detail that should live in a project doc). Do NOT
rewrite. Output ONE JSON object per finding, one per line, NOTHING else. Schema:
{"severity":"error|warn|info","line":<integer or 0>,"message":"<one concise sentence>"}
Use "warn" for a clear violation; "info" for borderline; reserve "error" for roadmap sprawl so severe
it would mislead an automated planner. If ROADMAP.md honors the contract, output nothing.
